## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured methodology, including:

  1. ### Traffic Capture
     Wireshark was used to capture network traffic generated by the malware.

  2. ### Packet Inspection
      In-depth analysis of captured packets to identify communication protocols, patterns, and potential malicious activities.

  3. ### Behavioral Analysis
     Examination of the malware's behavior within the network, including interactions with external servers and internal systems.

## Data Collection
The dataset used for this analysis consists of network traffic captured during the execution of the malware. The packet capture file (PCAP) is included in this repository for reference.

## Usage
* Clone the repository.
* Open the provided PCAP file in Wireshark for further analysis.
* Review the analysis results
